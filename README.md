Compatible Controllers
======
This software was written and adopted to be used by me on ASUS ROG Ally Handheld if two modes 'Handheld' and docked handheld with 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller connected via bundled 2.4GHz adapter.

But it should be supported by any XInput compatible controller like Xbox360, Xbox One and work on any Windows 11 based x86_64 platforms


About AllyG360
======

AllyG360 is a utility for couch-oriented PC users that wish to entirely control their PC from the couch with a controller. AllyG360 works by transforming Xbox (or PlayStation, if using DS3Tool) controller input into traditional keyboard and mouse input that many applications and games still completely rely on with no controller-based alternative input options. The analog sticks move the mouse, the buttons click - it's very simple. AllyG360 completely skips this requirement and brings controller compatibility to ALL your applications and MOST of your games. Games like Runescape will be just fine. Crysis? Maybe not so much. It all depends on what amount of traditional input the game requires. AllyG360 is an excellent tool for PC gaming from the couch, as it's fully capable of web browsing, playing mouse-based games, controlling media players, and launching emulators. Don't stand up and waste calories, just download AllyG360!

AllyG360 separates itself from the competition by being efficient, small, portable, free, and fully open. If you have something you'd like to see improved, added, or changed, please fill out the survey.

All above sentenced are from description of father of this project Gopher360 by Talemagne https://github.com/Tylemagne/Gopher360. I take it in late 2023 to use with ASUS ROG Ally Handheld and play from sofa using 8BitDo controller. My goal was to make original Gopher more user-friendly and fit my needings.
